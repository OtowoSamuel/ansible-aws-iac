# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Ansible and AWS

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Ansible to automate the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure on AWS. It showcases best practices for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to simplify and streamline infrastructure management and deployment processes.

## Features

- **Automated Provisioning:** Set up AWS resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS instances using Ansible playbooks.
- **Efficient Management:** Manage and configure AWS resources with ease, reducing manual intervention and errors.
- **Real-World Application:** Practical examples and configurations for deploying infrastructure on AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before running the playbooks, ensure you have the following:

- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) installed on your local machine.
- An AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions to create and manage resources.
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials. You can configure it using `aws configure`.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:**
   Ensure that your AWS credentials are set up. You can use the AWS CLI to configure them:
   ```bash
   aws configure


3. **Install Required Ansible Collections:**
   Install the necessary Ansible collections for AWS:
   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws


4. **Run the Ansible Playbooks:**
   Execute the playbooks to provision and configure the AWS infrastructure. For example:
    ```bash
   ansible-playbook s3_rds.yaml


## Project Structure

s3_rds.yaml: Ansible playbook for configuring S3 buckets and RDS instances.
